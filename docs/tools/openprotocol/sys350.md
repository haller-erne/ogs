## Loosen modes

System350 based tools mainly fall into two categories:

- ErgoSpin tools (used in ErgoSpin hand-tool mode)
- Single spindle tools and ErgoSpin tools used in spindle mode
- Multi-spindle tools

Spindle tools (and ErgoSpin in spindle mode) use externally connected start switches (for start CW, start CCW), whereas ErgoSpins in hand-tool mode use the built-in direction selector switch and start switch.

Additional notes:

- Check the PSet parameter setting "play with start switch"
- Check the `CHANNEL_<tool>_CCW_ACK` setting for the tool in `station.ini`

For the `CHANNEL_<tool>_CCW_ACK` setting, the following is recommended:

- If you use an ErgoSpon tool, then use `CHANNEL_<tool>_CCW_ACK=1` to enforce changing the direction switch on the ErgoSpin according to tighten/loosen.
- If you use a spindle tool with seperately wired CW/CCW and start signals, then set `CHANNEL_<tool>_CCW_ACK=1`
- If you use a spindle tool with CW start and CCW start signals, then set `CHANNEL_<tool>_CCW_ACK=0`

### Single channel tool

The signals used in this scenario are:

- CW
- CCW
- CcwSel
- CwLock, CcwLock
- CwAnd, CcwAnd

### Multi channel tool
