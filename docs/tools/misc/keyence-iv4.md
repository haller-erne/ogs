# Keyence IV4 AI Vision Sensor

![IV4 camera](resources/keyence-iv4.png) {aliugn=right, width="200"}
The IV4 Series can detect parts without using position adjustment, can check if the correct amount of parts are in their proper location, and can read and count targets under tough conditions. The IV Series is known for its simplicity and stability and the IV4 is stronger in these than ever before. Increased brightness, wide-and-narrow field-of-view options, and highly optimised built-in hardware mean that the IV4 is highly stable against environmental concerns like ambient lighting or slight finish changes. Even applications that are difficult for conventional vision sensors can be solved easily with the IV4 and its improved AI tools.
