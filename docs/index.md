# OGS - Operator guidance system

## Scope

This documentation provides low-level infomation about the OGS software. 
The main purpose is to document the API interfaces (mostly LUA scripting), the available (tool)drivers and show how everything fits together. 
This allows advanced users and implementors to unlock the full potential 
of OGS by modifying and extending the software.

**NOTE:** This documentation is valid for OGS V3. As V3 is not yet released, some of the information might still change before the final release.

## Overview

The documentation currently has the following information:

- Tool driver and tool configuration information (see [Tool configuration](/docs/tools/README.md))
- LUA scripting (see [LUA scripting](/docs/v3/getting-started.md))
- LUA helper libraries (see [LUA libraries](/docs/libs/README.md))
