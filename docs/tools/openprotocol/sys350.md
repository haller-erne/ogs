## Loosen modes

System350 based tools mainly fall into two categories:

- ErgoSpin tools (used in ErgoSpin hand-tool mode)
- Single spindle tools and ErgoSpin tools used in spindle mode
- Multi-spindle tools

Spindle tools (and ErgoSpin in spindle mode) use externally connected start switches (for start CW, start CCW), whereas ErgoSpins in hand-tool mode use the built-in direction selector switch and start switch.

Additional notes:

- Check the PSet parameter setting "play with start switch"

### Single channel tool

The signals used in this scenario are:

- CW
- CCW
- CcwSel
- CwLock, CcwLock
- CwAnd, CcwAnd

### Multi channel tool
