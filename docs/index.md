# OGS - Operator guidance system

This documentation provides low-level infomation about the OGS software. 
The main purpose is to document the API interfaces (mostly LUA scripting) and show how everything fits together. 
This allows advanced users and implementors to unlock the full potential of OGS 
by modifying and extending the software.
