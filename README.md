## Documentation

The documentation is automatically generated from the ./doc subfolder using mkdocs (see [link](https://medienstudio.net/development-en/documentation-in-github-pages-with-mkdocs-readthedocs-theme/) for the setup) and published at [https://haller-erne.github.io/ogs/](https://haller-erne.github.io/ogs/).


## Notes

- To use the github web-based editor, press the `.` key (for more options, see [github.dev web-based editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor))
- The documentation uses [MkDocs]() with the incredibly powerful [Material for MkDocs]() theme. Here are some quick hints:
   - [MkDocs Material Reference](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/)
   - [Mkdocs Docmarks Cheat Sheet](https://yakworks.github.io/docmark/cheat-sheet/) - note, that this actually refers to the `Docmarks` theme and not the `Material` theme, but is nevertheless helpful.
